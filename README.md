This is my project for CS-340, a Client/Server Development class at SNHU
I included a CRUD method developed in python to help read from my database in MongoDB, and display this database in a user friendly dashboard using Jupyter notebooks, which allows users to view the data table, sort it, and show a pie chart and geolocation of their chosen pet.
